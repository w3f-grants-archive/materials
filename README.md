## Apron Network

### Our wish

Connecting the service providers and application developers through the blockchain's infrastructure service market is Apron Network's goal. 



### What will we do

* A decentralized gateway is integrated within the Substrate-based blockchain node of Apron Network to let service providers publish and benefit from their services of any kind. 

* The multi-payment methods provided by the infrastructure service market enables service providers to enlarge the demand for their services, and the Token Subscription will ensure the benefits for the service providers and secure the token assets of service-users. 

* The decentralized Billing System in Apron Network will enable the ability to provide services without worrying about censoring from authorities for service providers, and service users will enjoy those services anywhere without barriers.
